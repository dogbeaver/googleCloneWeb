<<< Terminal >>>

git --version
==> to see what version git has been downloaded on my computer

git clone git@github.com:dogbeaver/python_prac1.git
==> SSH address, you will see the folder, my repo from github that's pulled down into directory that I am in.

cd demo 
==> you can put the folder name on (demo) to move inside of the folder quickly to change the directory into the folder.

* demo-repo git:(master) la 
==> ls -la (list everything in the directory including hidden files and folders / if you have mac, use ls -la)
==> then you will see the README file and something.git (and git will be blue color which means it's actually a folder
and this hidden git folder, actually stores all of the files that save your commits or codes of the times. It saves
all the history of repo.)


git status
-->  it shows everything.

but if i made another file with names <index.html>
then do 
git status 
--> it will appear as "Untracked files"
which means it does not recognize the "index.html" file yet.
So be able to recognize it, 
you have to add the file to the git.

git add .
==> and tell that which files to track. 
or

git add index.html


git commit -m "a"
--> m is message, and you need to have a message in order to commit your files.
message could be one character, or so, but you need a message. 
and ideally, should have something to do with what and why behind the commit you are making.


git commit -m "Added index.html" -m "some description"
==> you will see 
__ files changes, __ insertions(+)

but we still have saved it to locally, not in github yet.

git push 
--> be able to push your file to github, you have to prove that you are the owner of the hub.

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"


ls
--> you will see
testkey
testkey.pub
==> pub means public, it means it's okay to other people to see this key

cat testkey.pub
--> start with "ssh-rsa ~ email@example.com"


***then ive got lost.
